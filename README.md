## Coffee Brew App
This app will be a coffee brew guide. My goals for this project will be to create a minimal, searchable app with beautiful guides on how to brew coffee.

**Focus Points**
- Create a global theme to provide and light and dark theme
- Create higher-order components for buttons and modal
- Experiment with custom animations
- Focus on user interaction on touch screen devices (on touch/swipe)
- Use lifecycle methods (I started react with hooks, so I never had the chance to use them.)
- Create style loader card when data is not yet available

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
