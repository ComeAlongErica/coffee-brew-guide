## Note: this is currently a work-in-progress. Some functionality and error handling does not exist yet.

## Recipe Finder
This app will be a recipe finder app using API the Edamam. My goals for this project will be to create a minimal, searchable app with options to save and come back to recipes.

## [View Project](https://comealongerica.github.io/recipe-finder-guide/)

**Focus Points**
- Create a global theme to provide and light and dark theme
- Create higher-order components for buttons, modal, and cards
- Experiment with custom animations (slides, scoll, fade)
- Focus on user interaction
- Use lifecycle methods (I started react with hooks, so I never had the chance to use them.)
- Create loader card when data is not yet available
